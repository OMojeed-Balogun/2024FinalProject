# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Faceless

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A story about a person who loses their face.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I'm going to use RenPy to create a visual novel. It provides everything I need. Save states, History, and a menu are all things I feel are above my ability to an extreme extent. I hope to just write the story to its completion.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I don't have any other final projects.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I had no teammates.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

It functions and the story starts and concludes.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The story is good.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The story is great and I add game functionality.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I think the best skill I could gain is both refining the framework of the idea and acquiring good materials. I do't want to use AI art but I will if I have to. If I could draw I could do anything I want. Also, if I get better at refining the idea nad everything I'll need to do, the project will become like 10x eaiser (although I am massively overselling it).
